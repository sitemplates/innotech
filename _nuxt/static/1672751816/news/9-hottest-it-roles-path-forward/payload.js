It is the result of applying the agile paradigm to the entire service lifecycle from conception to production support. It requires the involvement of the development and operations engineers in all steps of the process and thus generalizing the automation efforts that previously were only seen during the development phases. The DevOps Engineer is a professional that introduces processes, tools, and methodologies and works with developers and IT staff to oversee the code releases. Responsibilities go from coding and deployment to maintenance and updates.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECloud Architect\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe are in a world dominated by cloud computing.

Data Analysts sift through data and seek to identify trends, discovering what stories do the numbers tell and what decisions should be made based on that. Data Scientists are pros at interpreting data, but also tend to have coding and mathematical modeling expertise. Most Data Scientists can do the work of a Data Analyst but are also hands-on in machine learning, statistics, data mining, data warehousing techniques, or schema design.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProject Manager\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2027, employers will need \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.pmi.org\u002F-\u002Fmedia\u002Fpmi\u002Fdocuments\u002Fpublic\u002Fpdf\u002Flearning\u002Fjob-growth-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003E87.7 million individuals\u003C\u002Fa\u003E working in project management-oriented IT roles.
